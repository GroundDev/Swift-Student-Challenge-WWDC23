영어보다 한국어가 편하시다면 국문 버전의 리드미도 준비했으니 참고해주시면 감사하겠습니다. [Korean Version](https://github.com/GroundDev/Swift-Student-Challenge-WWDC23/blob/main/README.kr.md)

### TextMeHappyBirthdayAtMidNight is an app that helps you intuitively accept the concept of time difference through experience.

### The overall flow of the app is as follows. 
The user becomes Minsoo and uses the elements in the app to deduce Jessica's birthday and send birthday messages as Jessica wishes.

### Planning intentions
I was talking about baseball with my team members who studied together at Apple Developer Academy @ POSTECH in the past, and someone said that the WBC final would be held in the U.S. And I joked, "Why does America always play baseball at night?" It's the same joke as Why does England always play soccer at night? to South Korean, but I suddenly had the following question. 
> Huh? Why can it be a joke that the United States plays baseball at night? 

The reason this question (though it's a joke of course) came up was that **the concept of time difference is not intuitive**. 

We gain knowledge in two main ways in our lives. The first is the knowledge you get from naturally encountering and experiencing in your daily life, and the second is the knowledge you get from someone delivering information in words and writing. Knowledge such as the existence of daily temperature difference or the clearer the air, the clearer the sky is, is the first knowledge you get from experience even if someone doesn't tell you, but the existence of time difference can't actually be experienced at all in your daily life. It's because a person has never existed in two places at the same time. So inevitably, the existence of time difference belongs to the second knowledge perceived through other people's words and writings. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that everyone on Earth got the concept of time difference from someone else in words and in writing.

Like this, the concept of time difference can only be obtained through words and writings. Does everyone can fully understand it through words and writings? Not at all. Because in order to understand the time difference, we have to explain it with the specific domain knowledge of earth science. To explain that one plus one equals two, two apples are enough. You can show in front of your eyes that if you put one and one together, there are two. However, explaining the time difference involves much more complex knowledge than two apples. It may be difficult to easily understand that as the Earth rotates, the area under sun changes and the time difference occurs with longitude. In addition to the concept of revolution and the fact that the earth is tilted a little bit, it's going to be much more difficult. The beginning was time difference, but before you know it, there will be a mishap where you have to bring professional photographs and explain them, and listeners will likely lose interest.

So, after all, is there no way to learn this concept of time difference? The good way I thought of it, is to experience it. The question will be how to experience the earth because humans cannot rotate the earth unless they become the God.
So I wanted to give the experience of becoming the God for a while to those who have not yet heard the concept of time difference from others, or those who have heard it but cannot accept the existence of time difference. Rather than listening to what time difference is by explaining with earth science knowledge, if you rotate the Earth as the God, you will be able to recognize and accept the occurence of time difference with your hands. And now that we have a medium that can express this easily and quickly to many people, that's a touchscreen-based mobile device, and Apple's iPad is the representative. Therefore, I developed an app that can be intuitively understood by experiencing the concept of time difference using Apple's device.

## Installation
To run this app, you can use the Swift Playgrounds app or Xcode. Since it was developed using SwiftUI only, installation of a separate Third Party Library is not required.

### Precautions
It is implemented based on the layout of the screen in Landscape mode. In other words, you can experience the app with a planned view only when you run it on a device or simulation environment with a horizontal length longer than a vertical length.

## Technologies & Development Environments
